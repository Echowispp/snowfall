		<p>Gravity and wind speed are, well, gravity and wind speed.</p>

			Of course, increasing wind speed not only changes the speed of the
			movement, but it also changes the angle to be more horizontal. Also,
			negative wind speed means it is pointing left

			Snowfall heaviness is in units of max amount of flakes on screen at
